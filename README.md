ต้อง install libary pid 

Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

Go to "Sketch" in the menu bar, then select "Include Library," and click on "Manage Libraries."

The Library Manager window will appear. In the search bar, type "PID" and press Enter.

Look for "PID by Brett Beauregard" in the search results. Click on the "Install" button next to the library.

The installation process will begin, and you'll see the progress in the status bar.

Once the installation is complete, you can close the Library Manager window.

To verify that the library is successfully installed, go to "File" > "Examples," and you should see "PID_v1" listed in the "Examples" section. This indicates that the library is installed and ready to use.
